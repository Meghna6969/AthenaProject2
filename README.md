Hello! This is my project for the Athena Award. The project is called Code Editor(I know, very original 😆), but unfortunately, Athena is about to end, and I want to get this in! This is an online code editor with basic file management based on client-side caching.

The editor does HTML, CSS, JS, and Py too. It has a built in console and preview to display the HTML contents live based on your changes and its works all offline with all your data being on your computer (Genuinely I dont even have the capacity to rob your data so Yeah 100% privacy)
